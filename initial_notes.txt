Design:

- rectangle shape outer container
- tabs for each category
- portrait images (like in collections tab in game)
- backlit/border (decide later coloring style) to indicate desirablity i.e. trying to get, got, not trying to get.  All stuff that would be user preference rather than base information
- write player progress to a file for future loading (only stuff that isn't populated from wow client?)

Features:

* CONNECTION *
- connect to wow database
- search character by name and realm
- populate certain data and progress for the character through that 

* BATTLE PETS TRACKER *
- very basic because warcraftpets can do most things on it's own
- all pets with descriptions and locations
- can sort by alphabet, species, type (critter, mechanical, etc.)
- can filter by availability (always, weather, events, no longer available, etc.)

* REPUTATION TRACKER *
- keeps track of current reputation with each faction
- includes location
- includes what dailies exist and how to do them and how much rep you get from each task
- area that lists what you can buy from that faction at certain reps (mounts, tabards, etc.)



TODO:
